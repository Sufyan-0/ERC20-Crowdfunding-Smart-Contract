# ERC20-Crowdfunding-Smart-Contract

     Users can pledge and transfer their token to a campaign.
     Users can also unpledge their token if the campaign does not end.
     When a campaign ends, the campaign creator can claim the funds only if the total amount pledged is more than the campaign goal.
     Users can withdraw their pledge If the campaign ends and does not reach its goal.
